# ae-colour-palette-manager-extension
This is a simple after effects extension that implements a previous script I created (https://youtu.be/0z6gQCBNYCY).


To install this extension, follow below:
Copy "Colour Palette Manager" Folder to the following location

Windows: /User/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/CEP/extensions
Mac: Library/Application Settings/Adobe/CEP/extensions

Once copied to this folder, you will need to set your system variable "PlayerDebugMode" to 1. Refer to the tutorial included with this extension below for how to do this on your OS.

To properly use this extension, ensure you have a composition with a layer selected. Then press the big + button in the bottom left of the script. Be patient. The time the colour palette takes to generate will depend on the resolution of your image/video. Once complete the colours will appear in the extension, where you can add them to any active composition by pressing the associated "Comp" button.
